Back in 2022, I had an enlightenment: the thing we see as "information" could be anything, if it was valuable for at least one person. We had tools, literally cooked sand, that can remember indefinitely (not exactly, but come on). Why don't we put this to humanities use?

In 2023, me and my friend circle was focusing on one specific problem: how can one achieve their true potential? There had to be a set of rules, some sort of guide to be followed. A way to ask questions, that gives different but accurate answers to the enquirer.

A map of being a human, but the best; when asked a question will lay out different answers, for you to test.

I've been closely watching "tpot" over on X, a community with people from background in tech, engineering, computer science and more. There's a culture of writing articles, which I really like, and find important to collect, organize and propagate.

This idea of establishing a wiki, a guide, a well of knowledge was in my bucketlist; but now I believe it's the best time.

I'm only the facilitator of the service, or the framework. I need your help, and your attention.

I don't like Medium. We <u>have</u> to support open-source solutions, created by people just like us. We <u>have</u> to support ourself.

Let's fight the information asymmetry and the centralization of technology together.
