## welcome to getcracked.wiki!

Thanks for checking by, I hope you love the content. getcracked.wiki is a open community of cracked people, writing about what they're best at.

This website is powered by [SvelteKit](), and all content is stored in plain Markdown in [our GitHub repository](). This means two things:

1. you can use almost any text editor (neovim, emacs, obsidian, logseq, etc.) to create articles,
2. the data is not **trapped** anywhere, and is owned by the community.

### what it supports

We support standart Markdown: *italic*, **bold**, ***italic and bold***, <u>underlined using HTML tag</u>.

We have <sub>subscripts</sub> and <sup>superscripts</sup>. ~~Strikethrough~~, too.

> Quotes.
>
> `code in quotes`
>
> E=mc<sup>2</sup>

#### Callouts

<Callout>
An example callout. Find the source code in `$lib/components/Callout.svelte`
</Callout>

<Callout type='warning'>
With types.
</Callout>

<Callout type='caution' title='cool error'>
Even with custom titles!
</Callout>

#### Code blocks

```
Standart monospace code blocks. uses Fira Code.
```

```python
# with syntax highlighting!
print(chr(0x0D9E))
```

#### Links

[Inline links](https://example.org), or [referenced links][1].
